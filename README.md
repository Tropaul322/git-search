# Git Search App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## information

This app will help you to find GitHub users and their repositories by their `username`

You need just to type `username` in the header input and then press `Enter` on keyboard
Then, if this username is existing on screen will appear user information and repositories.
 
## Happy hacking! =)
